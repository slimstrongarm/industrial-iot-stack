# Claude Discord Integration Vision

## Project Overview
Create a Discord-based command and control system for distributed Claude Code instances in an IoT project. This system will allow natural language interaction with multiple Claude instances from mobile devices, eliminating the need to SSH into terminals for troubleshooting and coordination.

## Current Architecture
- **Mac Instance**: Local Claude Code instance with SSH/TMUX setup
- **Server Instance**: Remote Claude Code instance on Windows Server (connected via Tailscale)
- **Shared Resources**: Google Sheets, GitHub repository
- **Technology Stack**: MQTT, N8N, Node-RED, Docker
- **Communication**: Currently manual coordination between instances

## Target Solution: Discord as Command Interface

### Core Functionality
Replace manual terminal interaction with natural language Discord interface accessible from iPhone and other devices.

### Discord Server Structure
```
IoT Project Server
├── #mac-claude          (Mac instance updates & commands)
├── #server-claude       (Server instance updates & commands)  
├── #general            (Cross-instance coordination)
├── #alerts             (Automated system alerts)
└── #logs               (Centralized logging channel)
```

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Natural Language Processing
- Each Claude Code instance monitors its designated Discord channel
- Responds to natural language commands like:
  - "Check if MQTT broker is running"
  - "Restart the stuck N8N workflow"
  - "Show me the current Docker container status"
  - "Deploy latest config changes"
  - "What's causing the Google Sheets sync delay?"

### 2. Automated Status Updates
- Proactive notifications when intervention needed
- Status updates during long-running operations
- Error alerts with context and suggested solutions
- Completion confirmations for requested actions

### 3. Cross-Instance Coordination
- Both instances can participate in shared conversations
- Automatic coordination for multi-instance operations
- Conflict resolution when both instances need same resources
- Synchronized deployments and configuration updates

### 4. Mobile-First Design
- Optimized for iPhone Discord app interaction
- Quick response times for troubleshooting scenarios
- Rich media support (screenshots, logs, diagrams)
- Voice message support for complex explanations

## Technical Implementation

### Discord Bot Setup
Each Claude Code instance should:
1. Create Discord application with bot token
2. Join designated channels with appropriate permissions
3. Implement webhook listeners for real-time updates
4. Set up message parsing and response logic

### Core Functions to Implement

#### Message Monitoring
```python
# Monitor Discord channel for messages
# Parse natural language intent
# Determine if response/action required
# Execute appropriate system commands
# Report results back to channel
```

#### System Integration
```python
# Docker container management
# MQTT broker monitoring and control
# N8N workflow status and management  
# Node-RED flow control
# Google Sheets API integration
# GitHub operations
# File system monitoring
```

#### Cross-Instance Communication
```python
# Coordinate with other Claude instances
# Share status and state information
# Prevent conflicting operations
# Synchronize configuration changes
```

## Expected Benefits

### Immediate Improvements
- **Reduced Troubleshooting Time**: From hours to minutes via mobile access
- **Faster Response**: No need to find computer and SSH in
- **Better Coordination**: Both instances visible in same conversation
- **Persistent History**: All interactions logged and searchable

### Long-term Advantages
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Instances can alert before failures occur
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Solutions and fixes documented in chat history
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more instances or team members
- **Remote Management**: Full system control from anywhere

## Success Metrics
- Troubleshooting time reduced by 75%
- Faster incident response (< 5 minutes from mobile)
- Improved coordination between instances
- Reduced manual SSH sessions
- Better documentation of system operations

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Discord Integration (CT-021 to CT-023)
1. **CT-021**: Create Discord server with channel structure
2. **CT-022**: Create Discord bot application in Developer Portal
3. **CT-023**: Deploy Discord bot container with monitoring capabilities

### Phase 2: System Integration (CT-024 to CT-025)
1. **CT-024**: Connect Discord bot to existing Google Sheets API
2. **CT-025**: Implement basic Discord commands (/status, /health, /containers)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (CT-026 to CT-027)
1. **CT-026**: Setup automated Docker alerts to Discord channels
2. **CT-027**: Deploy Discord bot to production for brewery demo

### Phase 4: Cross-Instance Features (Future)
1. Coordinate with Mac-Claude instance via Discord
2. Add shared operation capabilities
3. Implement conflict resolution
4. Test mobile troubleshooting workflows

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Future)
1. Proactive monitoring and alerts
2. Automated problem resolution
3. Performance optimization
4. Enhanced mobile interface features

## Discord Server Setup Requirements

### Channels Structure
- **#mac-claude**: Commands and status for Mac Claude instance
- **#server-claude**: Commands and status for Server Claude instance
- **#general**: Cross-instance coordination and general discussion
- **#alerts**: Automated system alerts and notifications
- **#logs**: Centralized logging from all systems

### Bot Permissions Required
- Send Messages
- Read Message History
- Use Slash Commands
- Embed Links
- Attach Files
- Manage Messages (for cleanup)

### Security Considerations
- Bot tokens stored securely in environment variables
- Channel-specific permissions to prevent cross-contamination
- Rate limiting to prevent Discord API abuse
- Secure credential handling for system access

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Google Sheets Integration
- Bot reads Claude Tasks for new assignments
- Updates task status and completion in real-time
- Posts progress summaries to Discord channels
- Syncs Human Tasks for cross-instance coordination

### Docker Integration
- Monitor container health and status
- Receive alerts for container failures
- Execute container management commands
- Display resource usage and logs

### MQTT/IoT Integration
- Monitor MQTT broker status
- Display real-time sensor data
- Alert on equipment failures
- Control industrial equipment via commands

## Technical Notes
- Use Discord.py library for bot implementation
- Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Ensure secure handling of system credentials
- Plan for graceful degradation if Discord unavailable
- Consider rate limiting for Discord API calls
- Use asyncio for non-blocking operations
- Implement logging and monitoring for bot health

## Brewery Demo Scenario

### Demo Flow (Friday Target)
1. **Setup**: Discord server running with both Mac and Server Claude bots
2. **Monitoring**: Real-time brewery equipment status via Discord
3. **Alert**: Simulated equipment failure triggers Discord notification
4. **Response**: Mobile command issued via Discord to restart service
5. **Resolution**: Confirmation and status update posted to Discord

### Key Demo Points
- **Mobile Access**: Demonstrate full control from iPhone Discord app
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live equipment status updates
- **Rapid Response**: Quick issue resolution without computer access
- **Professional Interface**: Clean, organized Discord interface
- **Scalability**: Show how additional equipment/sites could be added

## Questions for Implementation
1. Preferred Discord library/framework? → Discord.py recommended
2. Authentication method for system access? → Use existing Google Sheets credentials
3. Log retention and rotation strategy? → Discord channel history + file logs
4. Backup communication method if Discord fails? → Google Sheets fallback
5. Integration priority order for existing tools? → Docker → MQTT → N8N → Node-RED

## Success Definition
The Discord integration will be considered successful when:
- Both Claude instances can be controlled via Discord from mobile
- System alerts are automatically posted to Discord
- Troubleshooting time is reduced by 75%
- Brewery demo runs smoothly from iPhone Discord app
- No SSH sessions required for routine operations
