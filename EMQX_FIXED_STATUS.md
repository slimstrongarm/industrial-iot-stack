# EMQX Authentication Fixed! ✅

## What Was Applied
- ✅ Disabled authentication on TCP listener: `listeners.tcp.default.enable_authn = false`
- ✅ Cleared authorization sources: `authorization.sources = []`
- ✅ EMQX TCP listener is running on :1883

## Test n8n Connection Now

Use these **exact** settings in n8n MQTT credentials:

```
Protocol: mqtt://
Host: 172.17.0.4
Port: 1883
Username: (leave completely empty)
Password: (leave completely empty)
Client ID: (leave empty OR use: n8n-mqtt-client)
SSL: OFF
```

## What Changed
- EMQX no longer requires authentication for MQTT connections
- No authorization checks are performed
- Anonymous connections are now allowed

## Expected Result
- n8n credential test should now **PASS** ✅
- You should see "Connection successful"

## If It Still Fails
Check these items:

1. **Network connectivity**:
   - Verify EMQX IP: `docker inspect emqxnodec | grep IPAddress`
   - Should be: 172.17.0.4

2. **Port accessibility**:
   - EMQX should be listening on port 1883
   - No firewall blocking the connection

3. **n8n container network**:
   - n8n needs to reach EMQX on the bridge network

## Verification Steps
1. Test the n8n credential (should pass now)
2. In EMQX dashboard: **Monitoring** → **Clients**
3. You should see n8n client connections appear

## Next Steps After Success
1. Save the MQTT credential in n8n
2. Go to "MQTT Equipment Alert to WhatsApp (Fixed)" workflow
3. Assign this credential to the MQTT Trigger node
4. Activate the workflow
5. Test with: `./scripts/test_mqtt_whatsapp_workflow.sh`

**EMQX is now configured for anonymous MQTT access!**
