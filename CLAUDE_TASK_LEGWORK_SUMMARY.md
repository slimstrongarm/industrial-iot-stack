## âš¡ Ready for 100% Autonomous Execution:

Once webhook URLs are provided:
1. **Update config files** (30 seconds)
2. **Deploy Discord integration** (2 minutes)  
3. **Test MQTT â†’ Discord flow** (1 minute)
4. **Verify all channels working** (2 minutes)

**Total setup time with webhook URLs: < 5 minutes**

## ðŸ“Š Task Status Updates Ready:

### Google Sheet Updates Prepared:
- **CT-013**: COMPLETED (API access working)
- **CT-021**: COMPLETED (Discord server created)  
- **CT-022**: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT (all components prepared)

### Next Tasks in Queue:
- CT-014: API Testing (likely already working)
- CT-016: Ignition Scripts (can begin preparation)
- CT-017: Integration Test (ready once Discord deployed)
