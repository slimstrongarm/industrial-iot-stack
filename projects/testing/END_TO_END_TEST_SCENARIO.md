## 🎯 **FRIDAY DEMO SCENARIO: "Boiler Overheating Crisis"**

### **Act 1: Equipment Monitoring (Real-time Data)**
1. **Ignition Edge** simulates Steel Bonnet brewery equipment
2. **Node-RED** reads OPC-UA tags every 1 second:
   - `Boiler_1/Temperature`: 185°F (normal)
   - `Boiler_1/SteamPressure`: 22 PSI (normal)
   - `Pump_1/FlowRate`: 75 GPM (normal)

3. **MQTT Publishing** to topics:
   ```
   brewery/data/ignition_opc/Boiler_1
   brewery/data/ignition_opc/Pump_1
   ```

### **Act 2: Critical Alert Triggered**
4. **Temperature Spikes** to 225°F (above 220°F threshold)
5. **Alert Bridge** detects threshold violation
6. **MQTT Alert** published to `iiot/alerts/critical`:
   ```json
   {
     "alertType": "Temperature Above Maximum",
     "equipmentId": "Boilers_Boiler_1",
     "severity": "Critical",
     "message": "Temperature is 225°F, above maximum of 220°F",
     "location": "Steel Bonnet Brewery - Boilers Area",
     "value": "225°F",
     "threshold": "160-220°F"
   }
   ```

### **Act 3: Instant Notifications**
7. **n8n MQTT Workflow** receives alert
8. **WhatsApp Message** sent immediately:
   ```
   🚨 INDUSTRIAL ALERT

   📍 Equipment: Boilers_Boiler_1
   🏭 Location: Steel Bonnet Brewery - Boilers Area
   ⚠️ Severity: Critical
   🔔 Type: Temperature Above Maximum

   💬 Message:
   Temperature is 225°F, above maximum of 220°F

   📊 Details:
   • Current Value: 225°F
   • Threshold: 160-220°F
   • Time: 6/3/2025, 4:30:00 PM

   🔧 Action Required: Please investigate immediately
   ```

9. **Google Sheets** logs the alert automatically

### **Act 4: Human Response & Commands**
10. **Maintenance Tech** receives WhatsApp alert
11. **n8n Command** triggered (manually or via another workflow):
    ```json
    {
      "command": "EmergencyShutdown",
      "parameter": "EmergencyShutdown", 
      "value": true,
      "datatype": "Boolean"
    }
    ```

12. **MQTT Command** published to `iiot/commands/Boilers_Boiler_1/EmergencyShutdown`

### **Act 5: Automated Response**
13. **Node-RED Command Bridge** receives MQTT command
14. **OPC-UA Write** to Ignition tag: `ns=2;s=Steel_Bonnet/Equipment/Boilers/Boiler_1/EmergencyShutdown`
15. **Ignition** executes emergency shutdown
16. **Status Confirmation** published back via MQTT
17. **n8n** receives confirmation and logs to Google Sheets

## 🧪 **TEST COMMANDS FOR DEMO**

### **Manual Test Triggers:**

#### 1. **Test Alert Generation** (Node-RED)
```javascript
// Inject into "Manual Test Alert" node
{
  "alertType": "Temperature Threshold",
  "equipmentId": "Boilers_Boiler_1", 
  "severity": "Critical",
  "message": "Temperature is 225°F, above maximum of 220°F",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-03T16:30:00Z",
  "location": "Steel Bonnet Brewery - Boilers Area",
  "value": "225°F",
  "threshold": "160-220°F"
}
```

#### 2. **Test WhatsApp Alert** (n8n Manual Execution)
- Go to n8n workflow: "MQTT to WhatsApp Industrial Alerts"
- Click "Execute Workflow"
- Use test payload above

#### 3. **Test Command Execution** (Node-RED)
```javascript
// Inject into "Test: Start Pump" node
{
  "command": "Start",
  "parameter": "Start",
  "value": true,
  "datatype": "Boolean"
}
```

#### 4. **Test Setpoint Change** (Node-RED)
```javascript
// Inject into "Test: Flow Setpoint" node  
{
  "command": "SetFlowRate",
  "parameter": "FlowRateSetpoint",
  "value": 85.5,
  "datatype": "Double"
}
```

## 📋 **DEMO CHECKLIST**

### **Pre-Demo Setup:**
- [ ] ✅ Server Claude deploys n8n stack with PostgreSQL
- [ ] ✅ Import both n8n workflows (Formbricks→Sheets + MQTT→WhatsApp)
- [ ] ✅ Configure WhatsApp Business API credentials in n8n
- [ ] ✅ Import Node-RED flows: Alert Bridge + Command Bridge
- [ ] ✅ Verify MQTT broker (EMQX) running on server
- [ ] ✅ Test WhatsApp message delivery
- [ ] ✅ Verify Google Sheets logging
- [ ] ✅ Test Ignition OPC-UA connection (or simulation mode)

### **Live Demo Flow:**
1. **Show Dashboard** - Node-RED monitoring dashboard with live data
2. **Trigger Alert** - Manually inject high temperature value
3. **Show WhatsApp** - Real-time alert message received
4. **Show Google Sheets** - Alert automatically logged
5. **Execute Command** - Send emergency shutdown via n8n
6. **Show Response** - Ignition tag updated, status confirmed
7. **Show Audit Trail** - Complete loop documented in sheets

### **Backup Demos (if issues):**
- **Form Collection** - Formbricks → n8n → Google Sheets 
- **Equipment Simulation** - Node-RED simulated data dashboard
- **Manual n8n Execution** - Trigger workflows manually
- **MQTT Topic Explorer** - Show live MQTT data flow

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING SCENARIOS**

### **If Ignition OPC-UA Not Available:**
- Node-RED automatically switches to **simulation mode**
- Still generates realistic Steel Bonnet brewery data
- All other components work identically

### **If WhatsApp Not Configured:**
- n8n workflow shows execution logs
- Google Sheets logging still works
- Demo focuses on data collection and processing

### **If MQTT Issues:**
- Node-RED has internal data flows
- Can inject test data manually
- Show architecture and potential
