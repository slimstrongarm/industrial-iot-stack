## 📊 Context from Adjacent Tasks

### Related Parachute Drop System Tasks:
- **CT-084**: Parachute Drop System (Complete) - Building Parachute Drop Pi image with enhanced discovery agents
- **CT-085**: Network Discovery Agent (Complete) - Deploy network discovery agent for PLCs, MQTT brokers, and Modbus devices  
- **CT-087**: Sensor Auto-Configuration (Not Started) - Automatic sensor detection and dashboard generation for Phidget sensors
- **CT-088**: Legacy Protocol Support (Not Started) - Deploy legacy protocol support for Modbus RTU, BACnet MS/TP, and DF1

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements (Inferred)

Based on the task description, CT-086 involves:

### GL.iNet Router Configuration:
1. **Isolated Network Setup**
   - Configure separate network segment for industrial devices
   - Implement network isolation and security policies
   - Set up VLAN or subnet segregation

2. **VPN Tunnel Implementation**
   - Configure secure VPN connection for remote access
   - Set up VPN server/client depending on architecture
   - Implement secure authentication and encryption

3. **Traffic Monitoring**
   - Deploy network monitoring tools
   - Configure traffic analysis and logging
   - Set up alerts for unusual network activity

4. **Secure Remote Access**
   - Configure remote management capabilities
   - Implement secure access controls
   - Set up remote monitoring dashboards

## 🎯 Integration Points

### With Completed Tasks:
- **CT-084**: The Pi image from CT-084 likely needs network connectivity through this router
- **CT-085**: The network discovery agent may need to scan through this router's network segments

### With Pending Tasks:
- **CT-087**: Sensor auto-configuration will need network connectivity for Phidget sensors
- **CT-088**: Legacy protocol support will need network routing for Modbus/BACnet communications

## 📱 Deployment Context

This task is part of the **Parachute Drop System** - a portable industrial IoT deployment system that can be rapidly deployed in industrial environments. The GL.iNet router serves as the networking backbone for:

- Edge computing devices (Raspberry Pi from CT-084)
- Industrial sensors and PLCs (discovered by CT-085)
- Remote monitoring and data collection
- Secure communication back to central systems

## 🔄 Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Router Setup
1. Configure GL.iNet router hardware
2. Set up basic network configuration
3. Implement network isolation

### Phase 2: VPN Configuration
1. Configure VPN tunnel (likely OpenVPN or WireGuard)
2. Test secure remote connectivity
3. Set up authentication and access controls

### Phase 3: Monitoring Implementation
1. Deploy traffic monitoring tools
2. Configure dashboards and alerts
3. Test monitoring capabilities

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
1. Test integration with CT-084 Pi image
2. Validate network discovery through router
3. Test remote access capabilities

## 🚀 Success Criteria

- Router provides isolated network for industrial devices
- VPN tunnel allows secure remote access
- Traffic monitoring provides visibility into network activity
- System is validated for rapid deployment scenarios
- Professional dashboard available for remote monitoring
- Integration with other Parachute Drop System components verified

## 📞 Next Steps
