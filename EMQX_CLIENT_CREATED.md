# EMQX Client Created Successfully ✅

## What You've Accomplished
- ✅ Disabled MySQL Authentication
- ✅ Created MQTT client: `n8n-mqtt-client`
- ✅ Set permissions: Publish & Subscribe Allow

## Now Test n8n Connection

### In n8n MQTT Credentials, use:
```
Protocol: mqtt://
Host: 172.17.0.4
Port: 1883
Username: (leave empty)
Password: (leave empty)
Client ID: n8n-mqtt-client
SSL: OFF
```

### Important Notes:
1. **Client ID**: Must be exactly `n8n-mqtt-client` (what you created)
2. **Username/Password**: Leave empty since you disabled MySQL auth
3. **Permissions**: You set "Publish & Subscribe Allow" which is perfect

## Expected Result
- The n8n credential test should now **PASS** ✅
- You should see "Connection successful" or similar

## If It Still Fails
Try these troubleshooting steps:

### Option 1: Check Authorization
- Go back to **Access Control** → **Authorization**
- Make sure MySQL authorization is also disabled

### Option 2: Enable Anonymous Access
- Look for a global **"Allow Anonymous"** setting
- This might be under **Settings** or **Access Control**

### Option 3: Create User Authentication
If anonymous doesn't work:
1. **Access Control** → **Authentication** → **+ Add**
2. Choose **Built-in Database**
3. **Access Control** → **Users** → **+ Add User**
4. Create: `n8nuser` / `n8npass123`
5. Then use those credentials in n8n

## Verification
After successful n8n test:
1. Go to **Monitoring** → **Clients** in EMQX dashboard
2. You should see `n8n-mqtt-client` listed when n8n connects
3. You can then activate your MQTT workflow in n8n

**You're very close to having MQTT working! The client creation was the right step.**
