# 🎉 Quick Tour of Your Industrial IoT Stack Documentation

## What We Built:

### 📁 Structure Overview
```
industrial-iot-stack/
├── 📄 STACK-OVERVIEW.md      ← The "big picture" view!
├── 📁 stack-components/      ← Each tech gets its own space
│   ├── ignition-edge/       ← Already documented!
│   ├── node-red/           ← Ready for docs
│   ├── mqtt/               ← Ready for docs
│   └── ...more
├── 📁 templates/            ← Consistent documentation
└── 📁 scripts/             ← Automation (future)
```

### 🌟 Cool Features:

1. **Modular Documentation**
   - Each technology lives in its own folder
   - Multiple people/AIs can work on different parts simultaneously
   
2. **Unified Overview**
   - STACK-OVERVIEW.md aggregates everything
   - Shows status, integration points, architecture diagram
   
3. **Visual Architecture**
   - Mermaid diagram shows data flow
   - Integration matrix shows connections

4. **Template System**
   - Ensures consistent documentation
   - Makes it easy to add new components

### 🚀 Next Steps:

1. Open in new VS Code window: 
   ```bash
   code /Users/joshpayneair/Desktop/industrial-iot-stack
   ```

2. Create GitHub repo and push

3. Start documenting Node-RED:
   - Copy template to `stack-components/node-red/`
   - Fill in Node-RED specific details

4. Link to your Steel Bonnet scripts

### 💡 Usage Ideas:

- Each team member maintains their component docs
- CI/CD can auto-generate overview from component docs
- Use for onboarding new team members
- Track implementation progress across the stack
- Plan integrations by seeing all components together

This structure scales beautifully as you add more IIoT components!
