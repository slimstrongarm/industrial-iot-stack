# Flint Connection Status

## Current Status as of 2025-05-31 @ 2:14 PM
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Module installed, Flint activated, awaiting workspace configuration

## What's Working
âœ… Ignition Gateway running (http://localhost:8088)
âœ… Scan endpoint module v1.0.0 installed and running
âœ… Module endpoints verified:
  - GET /data/project-scan-endpoint/confirm-support returns {"supported":true}
  - POST /data/project-scan-endpoint/scan triggers scan successfully
âœ… "Trigger a Gateway Project Scan" button visible in Designer
âœ… Flint extension activated in VS Code
âœ… Workspace file created with gateway configuration

## Current Issue
- Flint shows "No Ignition gateways configured" despite settings
- Need to open workspace file to load gateway configuration properly

## Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE**: File â†’ Open Workspace from File...
2. Select: `/Users/joshpayneair/Desktop/industrial-iot-stack/industrial-iot-stack.code-workspace`
3. VS Code will reload with proper gateway settings
4. Check IGNITION GATEWAYS section in sidebar
5. If gateway appears, click to browse projects

## Key Information
- Gateway: http://localhost:8088 (admin/password)
- Module location: ignition-project-scan-endpoint/build/
- Workspace file: industrial-iot-stack.code-workspace
- VS Code settings: .vscode/settings.json (also configured)

## Troubleshooting If Still Not Working
1. Check VS Code Output â†’ Ignition Flint for errors
2. Try Command Palette â†’ "Ignition Flint: Refresh Ignition Gateways"
3. Verify gateway is accessible: curl http://localhost:8088/data/project-scan-endpoint/confirm-support -u admin:password
4. Check if Flint needs a specific project open first
