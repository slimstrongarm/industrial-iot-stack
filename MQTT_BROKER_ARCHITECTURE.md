# MQTT Broker Architecture - CRITICAL

## ðŸš¨ Important: Two Different MQTT Brokers

### Mac Instance (Green TMUX)
- **Broker**: Mosquitto
- **Port**: 1883 (default)
- **Purpose**: Local development, testing
- **Topics**: Development/test topics

### Server Instance (Blue TMUX)
- **Broker**: EMQX
- **Port**: 1883 (default) - CHECK IF DIFFERENT
- **Purpose**: Production, POC demo
- **Dashboard**: Usually on port 18083
- **Topics**: Production brewery topics

## Key Differences

### Mosquitto (Mac)
- Lightweight, simple configuration
- Config file: mosquitto.conf
- Basic authentication
- No built-in dashboard
- Command line tools: mosquitto_pub, mosquitto_sub

### EMQX (Server)
- Enterprise-grade features
- Web dashboard for monitoring
- Advanced authentication (built-in)
- Clustering support
- REST API for management
- Better performance monitoring

## Testing Commands

### For Mosquitto (Mac):
```bash
# Subscribe
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "test/#" -v

# Publish
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "test/message" -m "Hello from Mac"
```

### For EMQX (Server):
```bash
# Subscribe (might need auth)
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "iiot/#" -v

# Or use EMQX's own CLI
emqx_ctl topics list
emqx_ctl stats

# Check dashboard
http://server-ip:18083
# Default login often: admin/public
```

## Inter-Broker Communication

### Option 1: MQTT Bridge
Configure Mosquitto to bridge to EMQX:
```conf
# In mosquitto.conf
connection emqx-bridge
address server-ip:1883
topic # out 0
topic # in 0
```

### Option 2: Node-RED Bridge
Use Node-RED to subscribe to one broker and publish to another

### Option 3: Direct Client Connections
Have clients connect to both brokers as needed

## For Friday Demo

### Data Flow:
```
Field Devices â†’ EMQX (Server) â†’ Processing â†’ Visualization
                     â†“
              Test Bridge
                     â†“
            Mosquitto (Mac) â†’ Development Testing
```

## âœ… Completed Tasks (Server Claude CT-001 to CT-004)
1. âœ… Server audit completed - Docker services documented
2. âœ… EMQX broker deployed and operational on port 1883
3. âœ… EMQX dashboard confirmed running on port 18083
4. âœ… MQTT connectivity tested between Mac Mosquitto and Server EMQX
5. âœ… Docker Compose configuration created for full stack

## Status Update (June 3, 2025)
- **EMQX Deployment**: Fully operational on server
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Mac â†” Server MQTT communication verified  
- **Docker Integration**: Complete stack ready for n8n addition
- **Friday Demo Ready**: MQTT infrastructure prepared for demonstration

## Remaining Tasks
- Configure production topic namespace strategy
- Implement MQTT bridge for permanent sync (if needed)
- Add n8n to the Docker stack for workflow automation
