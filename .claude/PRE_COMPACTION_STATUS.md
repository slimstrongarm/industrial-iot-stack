# Pre-Compaction Status - 13% Remaining

## âœ… Current Status
- **Discord Bot**: Running and responding to mentions
- **Start Task Feature**: Added to `industrial_iot_claude_bot.py` 
- **Issue**: Google Sheets authentication failing ("Connection reset by peer")

## ðŸš€ Key Achievement
**Start Existing Task Feature** successfully added:
```python
# New command: @Mac Claude Bot start task CT-XXX
# Updates Google Sheets: Assigns task to instance, sets status to "In Progress"
# Function: handle_start_existing_task() in industrial_iot_claude_bot.py
```

## ðŸ”§ Post-Compaction Priority
1. **Fix Google Sheets connection** - likely auth token refresh needed
2. **Test start task feature**: `@Mac Claude Bot start task CT-094`
3. **Deploy Server Claude** with same feature

## ðŸ“‹ What's Ready
- Start existing task code is complete and ready
- Bot is running and listening
- Just needs Google Sheets connection fixed

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Session Goals
1. Resolve Sheets connection (likely credentials refresh)
2. Test both task creation and task starting
3. Deploy to Server Claude for full coordination
