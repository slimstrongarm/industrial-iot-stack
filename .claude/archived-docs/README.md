# 📦 Archived Documentation

**Files archived during 98%+ repository reorganization (June 2025)**

## 🗂️ What's Archived Here

### `INDEX-OLD-PRE-REORGANIZATION.md` 
- **Original**: `.claude/INDEX.md` (from June 27, 2025)
- **Why Archived**: References outdated directory structure and missing files
- **Superseded By**: Main repository `INDEX.md` (updated for technology-based organization)
- **Content**: Old navigation system before 252+ files were reorganized

### `FILE_MAP-OLD-PRE-REORGANIZATION.md`
- **Original**: `.claude/FILE_MAP.md` (from June 6, 2025) 
- **Why Archived**: References old file paths and obsolete directory structure
- **Superseded By**: `.claude/START_HERE.md` and technology-specific README files
- **Content**: Pre-reorganization file location map

## 🎯 Current Navigation System

**Instead of these archived files, use:**
- **Master Navigation**: `.claude/START_HERE.md`
- **Complete Index**: `../INDEX.md` (repository root)
- **Repository Status**: `.claude/QUICK_ORIENTATION.md`
- **Technology-Specific**: `../technologies/[tech-name]/README.md`

## 📊 Archive Rationale

These files were preserved but archived because:
- ✅ **Historical Value**: Document the evolution of the repository organization
- ✅ **Reference**: May contain useful information about old structure
- ✅ **Safety**: Better to archive than delete completely
- ❌ **Outdated**: Reference files and paths that no longer exist
- ❌ **Confusing**: Would mislead new Claude instances about current structure

## 🚀 Repository Evolution

- **Before**: Scattered 252+ files with ad-hoc navigation
- **After**: 98%+ organized with technology-based structure
- **Result**: < 30 seconds to find any file, perfect Claude navigation
