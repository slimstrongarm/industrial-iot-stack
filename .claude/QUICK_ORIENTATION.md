# ðŸš€ Quick Orientation - Repository Reorganization in Progress

## Current Status (June 28, 2025)
We're organizing 252+ scattered files into a clean technology-based structure.

## âœ… What's Done
```
technologies/
â”œâ”€â”€ mqtt/          âœ… 29 files organized
â”œâ”€â”€ node-red/      âœ… 13 files + 5 flows  
â”œâ”€â”€ discord/       âœ… 50 files (complete bot)
â””â”€â”€ google-sheets/ âœ… 16 files
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Next
Major technologies still need organizing:
- n8n (15 files)
- Ignition (9 files)
- Docker (5 files)
- GitHub Actions (8 files)
- Plus: Claude coordination files, project consolidation

## ðŸ’¡ How to Continue
1. Read `REPOSITORY_CLEANUP_HANDOFF.md` for detailed status
2. Check `REPOSITORY_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md` for the full strategy
3. Continue with n8n: `mkdir -p technologies/n8n/{setup-guides,workflows,integrations}`
4. Follow the pattern: move files, create README.md and INDEX.md

## ðŸ”‘ Key Achievement
New Claude instances can now find technology-specific files instantly:
- Working on MQTT? â†’ `technologies/mqtt/`
- Need Discord bot? â†’ `technologies/discord/bots/discord-bot/`
- Google Sheets integration? â†’ `technologies/google-sheets/`

Each technology has README.md for quick start and INDEX.md for complete file listing.
