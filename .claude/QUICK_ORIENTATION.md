# 🚀 Quick Orientation - Repository Reorganization in Progress

## Current Status (June 28, 2025)
We're organizing 252+ scattered files into a clean technology-based structure.

## ✅ What's Done (Phase 2 Complete!)
```
technologies/
├── mqtt/          ✅ 29 files organized
├── node-red/      ✅ 13 files + 5 flows  
├── discord/       ✅ 50 files (complete bot)
├── google-sheets/ ✅ 46+ files (expanded collection)
├── n8n/           ✅ 45+ files (workflow automation)
├── ignition/      ✅ 30+ files (SCADA platform)
├── docker/        ✅ 8+ files (containerization)
├── github-actions/✅ 8+ files (CI/CD integration)
├── whatsapp/      ✅ 6+ files (messaging)
└── formbricks/    ✅ 3+ files (forms/surveys)
```

```
claude-coordination/
├── handoffs/      ✅ 19+ session management files
├── sessions/      📁 Ready for session files  
├── status/        📁 Ready for status files
└── guides/        📁 Ready for guide files
```

## 🎯 What's Next (Finishing Touches)
Minor cleanup tasks remaining:
- Create README.md files for smaller technologies
- Update cross-references and links
- Final file organization verification

## 💡 How to Continue
1. Read `REPOSITORY_CLEANUP_HANDOFF.md` for detailed status
2. Check `REPOSITORY_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md` for the full strategy
3. Continue with n8n: `mkdir -p technologies/n8n/{setup-guides,workflows,integrations}`
4. Follow the pattern: move files, create README.md and INDEX.md

## 🔑 Key Achievement
New Claude instances can now find technology-specific files instantly:
- Working on MQTT? → `technologies/mqtt/`
- Need Discord bot? → `technologies/discord/bots/discord-bot/`
- Google Sheets integration? → `technologies/google-sheets/`

Each technology has README.md for quick start and INDEX.md for complete file listing.
