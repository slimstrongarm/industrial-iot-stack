- No interactive Claude communication
- Static alert system

### **After** (Once token is added):
```
Discord becomes a LIVE Claude interface:

🚨 [MQTT Alert] Equipment temperature high: 85°C

User: "@claude what caused this spike?"

Claude Bot: "🔍 Analyzing MQTT data... The temperature spike at 14:23 
corresponds with cooling pump flow drop detected in n8n workflow. 
Node-RED bridge shows valve V-301 may need attention. Recommend 
checking pump status and valve position."

User: "@claude can you help me restart the cooling system?"

Claude Bot: "🛠️ I can guide you through the restart process. First, 
check the EMQX broker for any error messages, then use the n8n 
workflow to send restart command to equipment/control topic."
```
