## üéØ **THE VISION**

Walk into ANY industrial facility and within 15 minutes:
- Have live sensor data on a professional dashboard
- Map their network and discover all connected devices  
- Identify PLC tags and their purposes using AI
- Leave behind an intelligent data collection system
- Return to office with complete facility intelligence

**This isn't just monitoring - this is industrial transformation!**

## üì¶ **PRE-DEPLOYMENT SETUP**

### 1. Kit Configuration (One-Time Setup)
```bash
# Flash Pi with pre-configured image  
sudo dd if=parachute-drop-v1.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M

# Or build from scratch
cd parachute-drop/
sudo bash pi-base-setup.sh
```

### 2. Auto-Configure Sensors (CT-084 Implementation)
```bash
# Detect connected Phidget sensors and generate dashboard
python3 auto-sensor-configurator.py

# Enhance for 7" touchscreen display
python3 touchscreen-dashboard-enhancer.py

# Import enhanced dashboard to Node-RED
# File: touchscreen_dashboard_flows.json
```

### 3. Professional Demo Interface
- **7" touchscreen** with professional brewery branding
- **Touch-optimized gauges** for temperature, humidity, current
- **Live trending charts** showing real-time sensor data
- **System status display** with "ü™Ç PARACHUTE DROP ACTIVE"
- **Auto-launch fullscreen** for impressive client demos

### 2. Load Sensor Configurations
```bash
# Copy sensor library to Pi
scp sensor-library.json pi@parachute-pi:/home/pi/
scp node-red-touchscreen-flow.json pi@parachute-pi:/home/pi/

# Import Node-RED flows
curl -X POST http://parachute-pi:1880/flows -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @node-red-touchscreen-flow.json
```

### 3. Test All Systems
- [ ] Pi boots and auto-starts dashboard
- [ ] Router creates "ParachuteDrop" WiFi network
- [ ] Phidget hub detects connected sensors
- [ ] MQTT broker accepts connections
- [ ] VPN tunnel establishes connection home

## üöÄ **ON-SITE DEPLOYMENT** 

### Phase 1: Network Establishment (5 minutes)

**Step 1: Power On**
```bash
# Pelican case ‚Üí Pi, Router, Touchscreen
# Connect power to router first, then Pi
# Pi auto-boots to dashboard on touchscreen
```

**Step 2: Network Creation**
- Router creates isolated network: `192.168.8.0/24`
- Pi gets static IP: `192.168.8.10`
- Facility laptop connects to: `"ParachuteDrop"` WiFi

**Step 3: Initial Dashboard**
- Touchscreen shows: "ü™Ç Parachute Drop Active"
- Browser access: `http://192.168.8.10:1880/ui`
- All systems green, waiting for sensors

### Phase 2: Sensor Deployment (5 minutes)

**Quick Sensor Placement Strategy:**
```
üå°Ô∏è Temperature: Motor bearing, process pipe, ambient
‚ö° Current: Main motor, pump, critical load  
üìä Pressure: Main process line, hydraulic system
üî≤ Digital: Motor contactor, main disconnect, alarm panel
```

**Sensor Connection:**
1. Phidget sensors ‚Üí Hub (auto-detection)
2. 4-20mA sensors ‚Üí Voltage ratio inputs with scaling
3. Digital inputs ‚Üí Contactor auxiliary contacts
4. Dashboard auto-updates with live readings

### Phase 3: Network Discovery (5 minutes)

**Automated Discovery Process:**
```python
# Run discovery agent
python3 discovery-agent.py

# Results appear on dashboard:
# - PLC devices found with IP addresses
# - MQTT brokers and active topics  
# - Modbus devices with register maps
# - Network topology diagram
```

**Manual Connections:**
- RJ45 from Pi ‚Üí PLC ethernet port (if accessible)
- USB-Serial ‚Üí Legacy Modbus RTU devices
- MQTT listener captures existing traffic
