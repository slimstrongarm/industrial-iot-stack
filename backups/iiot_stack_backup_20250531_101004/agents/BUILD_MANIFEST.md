# Integration Build Manifest
> Complete tracking for IIoT system build agents and progress

## 🎯 Mission Statement
Build a repeatable, scalable Industrial IoT integration system that connects Node-RED, Ignition Edge, n8n, and external servers with clear documentation and testing at every step.

## 📋 Agent Registry

### 1. Integration Builder Agent (`integration_builder_agent.js`)
**Purpose**: Orchestrate system integration and testing
**Status**: ✅ Created
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Deploy test tag creation flow to Node-RED
- [ ] Test equipment registration → tag creation pipeline
- [ ] Build n8n webhook integration bridge
- [ ] Configure external server connections
- [ ] Validate MQTT → Node-RED → OPC-UA → Ignition flow

### 2. Tag Creation Test Agent (`tag_creation_test_agent.py`)
**Purpose**: Validate tag creation from multiple sources
**Status**: 🚧 Planned
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test equipment registration creates correct tags
- [ ] Validate tag data types and structures
- [ ] Test batch tag creation performance
- [ ] Verify tag updates propagate correctly
- [ ] Generate tag creation reports

### 3. n8n Integration Agent
**Purpose**: Bridge n8n workflows with IIoT stack
**Status**: 📝 Design Phase
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create webhook receivers in Node-RED
- [ ] Map n8n actions to Ignition operations
- [ ] Build bi-directional data flow
- [ ] Create workflow templates for common operations
- [ ] Document n8n → Node-RED → Ignition patterns

### 4. External Server Connection Agent
**Purpose**: Connect to partner's server infrastructure
**Status**: 📝 Requirements Gathering
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Configure Tailscale networking
- [ ] Setup secure API endpoints
- [ ] Create data synchronization flows
- [ ] Implement error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Build connection health monitoring

## 🏗️ Build Progress Tracker

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] MQTT Broker running (Mosquitto)
- [x] Node-RED running with 8GB memory
- [x] Ignition Edge Gateway available
- [ ] OPC server started in Ignition
- [x] Test/debug nodes identified in Node-RED
- [x] Integration builder agent created

### Phase 2: Core Integration
- [ ] Import `test-tag-creation-flow.json` to Node-RED
- [ ] Verify OPC-UA write permissions
- [ ] Test equipment registration flow end-to-end
- [ ] Deploy remaining 14 untested Node-RED flows
- [ ] Validate MQTT discovery mechanisms

### Phase 3: External Connections
- [ ] Setup n8n instance
- [ ] Create Node-RED ↔ n8n webhooks
- [ ] Configure external server endpoints
- [ ] Test data flow to partner's server
- [ ] Implement monitoring dashboards

### Phase 4: Production Ready
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Build automated testing suite
- [ ] Generate system documentation
- [ ] Create operator training materials
- [ ] Package for client deployment

## 🔄 Repeatability Checklist

### Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Verify prerequisites
mosquitto -v                    # MQTT broker
node-red --max-old-space-size=8192  # Node-RED with 8GB
curl http://localhost:8088      # Ignition Gateway

# 2. Deploy agents
cd /path/to/industrial-iot-stack/agents
npm install                     # Install dependencies
node integration_builder_agent.js  # Run builder agent

# 3. Import flows
# In Node-RED UI: Import → Select file → test-tag-creation-flow.json
```

### Testing Sequence
1. Start MQTT broker
2. Start Node-RED with memory allocation
3. Start OPC server in Ignition Gateway
4. Run integration builder agent
5. Verify tag creation in Ignition
6. Test n8n webhook endpoints
7. Validate external server connectivity

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] 100% of equipment registrations create tags
- [ ] < 500ms latency for MQTT → Ignition
- [ ] Zero data loss in Store & Forward
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for critical flows

### Business Metrics
- [ ] Full deployment in < 2 hours
- [ ] Single script installation
- [ ] No manual configuration required
- [ ] Complete audit trail

## 🚨 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: OPC-UA connection refused
**Solution**: Start OPC server in Ignition Gateway settings

### Issue: Node-RED memory errors
**Solution**: Ensure `--max-old-space-size=8192` flag is set

### Issue: MQTT messages not flowing
**Solution**: Check mosquitto service and firewall rules

## 📝 Session Recovery Instructions

If this session is interrupted, resume by:

1. **Check current state**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/industrial-iot-stack
   cat agents/BUILD_MANIFEST.md | grep -A5 "Build Progress"
   ```

2. **Review last test results**:
   ```bash
   cat tag_creation_test_report.json
   ```

3. **Resume from last checkpoint**:
   - Find last completed task in this manifest
   - Run appropriate agent from that point
   - Update progress tracker
