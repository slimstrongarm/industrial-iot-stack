# Steel Bonnet IIoT Integration - Working Status

*Last Updated: May 30, 2025*

## 🚀 Current Sprint Focus
**Goal**: Validate MQTT → Node-RED → Ignition Edge data flow with self-aware equipment pattern

## System Status

### Infrastructure
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Ignition Edge Gateway | 🟢 Running | Trial mode started |
| Mosquitto MQTT | 🟡 Assumed Running | Port 1883 (needs verification) |
| Node-RED | 🟡 Unknown | Need to check status |
| Tailscale Network | 🟢 Active | Server connected |
| New Server | 🟢 Ready | Built by your hired help |

### Integration Points
| Connection | Status | Test Result |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| MQTT Local Pub/Sub | ⏳ Pending | Run test-mqtt-connection.sh |
| Node-RED → MQTT | ⏳ Pending | - |
| Node-RED → OPC-UA | ⏳ Pending | - |
| Pi → Phidget | 🟡 In Progress | You started working on this |

## 🎯 Current Focus: Option B - Get Simulation Creating Real Ignition Tags

1. **✅ MQTT broker working** - mosquitto running and can pub/sub
2. **✅ Node-RED running** - 8 flows active with test dashboard
3. **✅ Ignition Edge running** - OPC-UA server available at :62541
4. **✅ Architecture validated** - Data flows working with 56k+ MQTT messages processed
5. **⏳ Next**: Tag creation test flow ready for import

**Ready for Tomorrow:**
- Import test-tag-creation-flow.json into Node-RED
- Test actual tag creation in Ignition
- Debug any OPC-UA write permission issues

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Today's Goals
- [ ] Verify MQTT broker connectivity
- [ ] Get Node-RED connected to MQTT
- [ ] Create first equipment registration flow
- [ ] Test tag creation in Ignition
- [ ] Document working payload format

### This Week's Milestones
- [ ] Complete MQTT integration (TODO list)
- [ ] Deploy first Pi with real sensors
- [ ] Standardize Node-RED flows
- [ ] Create operator screen template

## 🤝 Team Coordination

### Your Controls Engineer Partner
- **Needs from us**: Stable tag structure, UDT definitions
- **Provides**: HMI screens, PLC integration
- **Handoff point**: Tag database in Ignition

### Server Admin (the kid you hired)
- **Needs from us**: Service requirements, backup needs
- **Provides**: Server infrastructure, Tailscale setup
- **Integration**: Remote access, central logging

## 📝 Key Decisions Made

1. **MQTT as quarantine** - Legacy devices go through MQTT validation
2. **Direct OPC-UA for Pi** - New devices skip MQTT layer
3. **Self-aware equipment** - Devices announce capabilities on startup
4. **UNS structure** - SteelBonnet/Brewery/{Area}/{Equipment}/{Point}

## ⚠️ Blockers & Issues

- None currently identified

## 🎉 Wins

- ✅ Complete documentation structure
- ✅ Clear architecture design
- ✅ Ignition Edge Gateway running
- ✅ Team roles defined

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# MQTT Testing
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "SteelBonnet/#" -v
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "SteelBonnet/Test/Hello" -m "Working!"

# Node-RED
http://localhost:1880

# Ignition
http://localhost:8088

# Check services
sudo systemctl status mosquitto nodered
```

## Next Check-in Points

1. **After MQTT test** - Update status, any issues?
2. **After Node-RED check** - Which flows are active?
3. **After first tag creation** - Did it work as expected?

Remember: Test small, fail fast, document everything! 🚀
