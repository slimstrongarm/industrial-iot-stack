# üöÄ CLAUDE HANDOFF - IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

## Your Mission: Connect Flint VS Code Extension to Ignition Gateway

### ‚úÖ Current Status
The scan endpoint module is **INSTALLED AND WORKING** in Ignition! We just need VS Code to recognize it.

### üéØ IMMEDIATE FIRST STEPS (Do These NOW!)

1. **Open the Workspace File**
   ```
   File ‚Üí Open Workspace from File...
   Select: /Users/joshpayneair/Desktop/industrial-iot-stack/industrial-iot-stack.code-workspace
   ```
   VS Code will reload with proper gateway configuration.

2. **Check Left Sidebar**
   Look for "IGNITION GATEWAYS" section. You should see "Local Edge Gateway".
   
3. **If Gateway Appears**
   - Click it to expand
   - Browse to test_run_01 project
   - SUCCESS! Move to "Next Goals"
   
4. **If Gateway Doesn't Appear**
   - Open VS Code Output panel (View ‚Üí Output)
   - Select "Ignition Flint" from dropdown
   - Look for error messages
   - Try: Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Ignition Flint: Refresh Ignition Gateways"

### üìä Quick Status Check Commands
```bash
# Verify Ignition is running
curl http://localhost:8088/data/project-scan-endpoint/confirm-support -u admin:password
# Should return: {"supported":true}

# Check Ignition process
ps aux | grep ignition | grep -v grep
# Should show Java process running
```

### üìÅ Key Files to Review
- `FLINT_CONNECTION_STATUS.md` - Detailed current status
- `agents/SESSION_STATE.json` - Full session context
- `TRIBAL_KNOWLEDGE_SYSTEM.md` - All accumulated knowledge

### üéØ Next Goals After Flint Connects
1. Configure MQTT Engine module in Ignition
2. Test Node-RED ‚Üí MQTT ‚Üí Ignition tag creation pipeline
3. Verify equipment registration system

### ‚ö° Quick Context
- Ignition Gateway: http://localhost:8088 (admin/password)
- Node-RED: http://localhost:1880
- MQTT Broker: Running on port 1883
- Trial Mode: ~30 minutes remaining as of 2:15 PM

### üî• Pro Tips
- The scan endpoint module is working (check Designer for "Trigger Gateway Project Scan" button)
- Flint extension is activated, just needs proper workspace loading
- All infrastructure is running and ready

Good luck! You're one workspace file away from success! üéâ
