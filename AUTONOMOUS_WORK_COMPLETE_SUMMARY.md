- **All major integrations** have working components
- **Testing & validation** frameworks established

## 🎯 What's Ready for You

### Immediate Actions (5-15 minutes each)
1. **Update Google Sheets** - Mark completed tasks (CT-013, CT-014, CT-016, CT-021)
2. **Deploy Discord Integration** - Get webhooks, deploy in 5 minutes
3. **Configure Google Sheets in n8n** - Upload credentials, test logging
4. **Get Formbricks API Key** - Complete that integration chain

### Medium Priority (Next Session)
1. **Install Ignition Scripts** - Ready for production deployment
2. **Test Full Integration Chains** - End-to-end validation
3. **Optimize Performance** - Based on established benchmarks

## 💡 Key Discoveries & Solutions

### Technical Breakthroughs
